# Diabetics-Detection-in-Children
Does frequent intake of sweets and sugary snacks cause Diabeties in Children?

In this project, I examine the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents"), a cross-sectional (medical) survey for Germany, which contains information on a wide array of children's objective health, education and behavioural measures in order to determine the feeding behaviour of children across different parts of Germany, and also to determine whether or not thier intake of sweets directly affect their blood sugar level.
